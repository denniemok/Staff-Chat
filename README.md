### Introduction
This is a lightweight plugin with exactly one function: facilitates staff communication in-game with a designated chat channel. Nothing fancy or complicated is involved. What it does is only the simplest task you ever ask for, hence the performance and size. <p>

Heavily inspired by [Staff Chat](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/staff-chat.17706/), this version, however, is much more simplified and straightforward and is developed using a minimalist approach.
